Link helps Data scientists and ML engineers build pipelines in their familiar environment (Jupyter, IDE). Pipelines can include model training, data loading, preprocessing, inference, and more.
The pipeline created in this way works with Kubeflow Pipeline and can also be executed in Kubeflow Pipeline.

Below is the pipeline created in JupyterLab as an extension of Jupyter. Each component represents a JupyterLab cell.
